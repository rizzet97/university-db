# university-db

Hi!

This is a work-in-progress project for the online C++ course by Coders-School.
It's main focus is learning the basics of OOP as well as managing and working with simple projects.

It will eventually allow user to manage a simple database containing names, surnames etc. of students by:
* adding new records
* deleting existing ones
* sorting the records by surneame or PESEL
* querying the records by surname or PESEL
