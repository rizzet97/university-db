Hi! 👋

This is a work-in-progress project for the online C++ course by [Coders-School](coders.school).
It's main focus is learning the basics of OOP as well as managing and working with simple projects.

It will eventually allow user to manage a simple database containing names, surnames etc. of students by:
* ➕ adding new records 
* ☠️ deleting existing ones 
* 📨 sorting the records by surname or PESEL 
* 🔎 querying the records by surname or PESEL 

As of now I don't plan on adding automated tests, but this may change in the future.
